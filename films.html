          <br />
          <p>
            The Japanese title is Kaze Tachinu.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intended to be Miyazaki’s swan song, The Wind Rises is a historical
            drama that just so happens to be animated. This one aims for a more
            adult audience. Call it “Jiro Dreams of Flying.” It’s about Jiro
            Horikoshi, the nearsighted Japanese engineer whose knack for the
            beauty of building inadvertently led him to invent the World War II
            “Zero” fighter plane.

          <h3>Ponyo (2008)</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Japanese title is Gake no Ue no Ponyo or “Ponyo on the Cliff.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In this movie, Miyazaki remixed The Little Mermaid into a Japanese
            fairy tale. Traditional hand-drawn animation had long since been
            overtaken by computer animation in the industry at large. Even
            Ghibli had employed CGI touches in its films, but for Ponyo, the
            studio went back to basics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything in this film was hand drawn. The result is a whimsical,
            kid-friendly entry into the Miyazaki canon.

          <h3>Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Japanese title is Hauru no Ugoku Shiro.
          </p>
          <p>
            Howl’s Moving Castle bears all the hallmarks of a Miyazaki film:
            castles, a love of aviation, strong heroines, witches and
            restlessness with the overbearing technology and disconnection from
            nature that is bred by contemporary life.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time, Miyazaki lit his thematic cocktail with an anti-war
            flame. The film came out during the Iraq War and Miyazaki
            incorporated his pacifism and preoccupation with aging into the
            movie’s colorful imagery. In this one, war machines peacock and pipe
            smoke over green hills, forming a cartoonish contrast with otherwise
            idyllic scenes of cottages and sheep herders.

          <h3>Spirited Away (2001)</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Japanese title is Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, or “Sen and
            Chihiro’s Spiriting Away.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Spirited Away continued Miyazaki’s winning streak in terms of
            overseas exposure. This is the film that is generally regarded as
            his masterpiece.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recent rankings in The New York Times and on BBC Culture have
            declared it the second and fourth best film of the 21st century,
            respectively. After becoming the biggest worldwide box office hit in
            Japanese history, the film won Best Animated Feature at the 75th
            Academy Awards.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is Miyazaki’s Alice in Wonderland or Wizard of Oz. The titular
            Sen (meaning “1,000”) and Chihiro (“1,000 fathoms”) are two
            different names for the same girl. Chihiro is her name before she
            enters the spirit world and Sen is her named after she starts
            slaving away at the bathhouse of the witch Yubaba — which is based
            on Dogo Onsen, Japan’s oldest onsen (hot spring spa), located in
            Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            A strange fantasy where parents turn to pigs, Spirited Away also
            furnished another popular Halloween costume: namely, that of the
            masked No-Face.

          <h3>Princess Mononoke (1997)</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Japanese title is Mononoke-hime.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my personal favorite Miyazaki film. In the West, it’s the
            one that served as his first big crossover success on home media.
            Miramax Films acted as the North American distributor for Princess
            Mononoke. However, its studio chairman was notorious for wanting
            foreign films chopped up into marketable stateside edits.
          </p>
          <p>
            That chairman was Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced mogul whose
            downfall precipitated the #MeToo movement around this time in 2017.
            As the story goes, Miyazaki sent a katana sword to Weinstein with
            the message: “No cuts.”
          </p>
          <p>
            One can well imagine him wanting to send the same message to
            deforesters. Princess Mononoke embodies the spirit of many Ghibli
            films in that it shows the clash between human civilization and
            nature. Spirits of the forest — including wolf, deer and boar gods —
            find their realm threatened by the residents of Irontown. A cursed
            prince, Ashitaka, attempts to mediate the growing conflict.

          <h3>Kiki’s Delivery Service (1989)</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Japanese title is Majo no Takkyūbin, or “Witch’s Delivery
            Service.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This film follows a young witch named Kiki who is sent out into the
            world to train with her talking black cat, Jiji. She utilizes her
            broomstick to start a delivery service and soon finds herself
            struggling with the witch’s equivalent of writer’s block, losing her
            ability to fly and comprehend her cat’s speech.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re ever at a big Halloween party in Japan, you’re likely to
            see more than one Kiki. Her navy blue frock and the signature red
            bow she wears in her hair make for a popular costume.

          <h3>My Neighbour Totoro (1988)</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Japanese title is Tonari no Totoro.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surveys have shown this to be Miyazaki’s most widely seen film on
            the home front here in Japan. The story involves two sisters,
            Satsuki and Mei, who befriend a rotund, whiskered creature in the
            forest as their mother copes with illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Totoro is Ghibli’s mascot and both he and the movie’s
            phantasmagorical Catbus have become cultural icons. Technically,
            Totoro is also a Disney/Pixar character, having appeared as one of
            the sentient stuffed animals in Toy Story 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, My Neighbor Totoro is celebrating its 30th anniversary.
            The film is filled with indelible images such as the one of Satsuki
            and the fanciful beast Totoro holding umbrellas at the bus stop in
            the rain. If you haven’t seen any Ghibli movies, this might be a
            good one to get you started.
