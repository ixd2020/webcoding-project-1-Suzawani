    <div class="biography">
      <span>H</span><b>ayao Miyazaki</b> (宮崎 駿, Miyazaki Hayao, [mijaꜜzaki
      hajaꜜo]; born 5 January 1941) is a Japanese animator, director, producer,
      screenwriter, author, and manga artist. A co-founder of Studio Ghibli, a
      film and animation studio, he has attained international acclaim as a
      masterful storyteller and as a maker of animated feature films, and is
      widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history
      of animation.
      <p>
        Born in Bunkyō ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and
        animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963.
        During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between
        artist and later collaborated with director Isao Takahata. Notable films
        to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include Doggie March and
        Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon. He provided key animation to other
        films at Toei, such as Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before
        moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin the Third Part I
        alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiyō Eizō (later known as Nippon
        Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece
        Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy Conan. He joined
        Telecom Animation Film/Tokyo Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first
        feature films, The Castle of Cagliostro in 1979 and Nausicaä of the
        Valley of the Wind in 1984, as well as the television series Sherlock
        Hound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. He directed numerous films
        with Ghibli, including Castle in the Sky (1986), My Neighbor Totoro
        (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), and Porco Rosso (1992). The
        films were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. Miyazaki's
        film Princess Mononoke was the first animated film ever to win the Japan
        Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and briefly became the
        highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997;[a] its
        distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity
        and influence outside Japan. His 2001 film Spirited Away became the
        highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for
        Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and is frequently
        ranked among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later
        films—Howl's Moving Castle (2004), Ponyo (2008), and The Wind Rises
        (2013)—also enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following the
        release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from
        feature films, though he returned to work on a new feature film in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as
        humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of
        natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and
        craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a
        violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or
        young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous
        antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly
        praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for
        outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the
        Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in
        November 2014. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for
        numerous animators, directors, and writers.

    <div class="biography">
      In June 1985, Miyazaki, Takahata, Tokuma and Suzuki founded the animation
      production company Studio Ghibli, with funding from Tokuma Shoten. Studio
      Ghibli's first film, Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), employed the same
      production crew of Nausicaä. Miyazaki's designs for the film's setting
      were inspired by Greek architecture and "European urbanistic templates".
      Some of the architecture in the film was also inspired by a Welsh mining
      town; Miyazaki witnessed the mining strike upon his first visit to Wales
      in 1984, and admired the miners' dedication to their work and community.
      Laputa was released on 2 August 1986. It was the highest-grossing
      animation film of the year in Japan. Miyazaki's following film, My
      Neighbor Totoro, was released alongside Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies
      in April 1988 to ensure Studio Ghibli's financial status. The simultaneous
      production was chaotic for the artists, as they switched between projects.
      My Neighbor Totoro features the theme of the relationship between the
      environment and humanity—a contrast to Nausicaä, which emphasises
      technology's negative effect on nature. While the film received critical
      acclaim, it was commercially unsuccessful at the box office. However,
      merchandising was successful, and the film was labelled as a cult classic.
      <p>
        Studio Ghibli set up its headquarters in Koganei, Tokyo in August 1992.
        In November 1992, two television spots directed by Miyazaki were
        broadcast by Nippon Television Network (NTV): Sora Iro no Tane, a
        90-second spot loosely based on the illustrated story Sora Iro no Tane
        by Rieko Nakagawa and Yuriko Omura, and commissioned to celebrate NTV's
        fortieth anniversary; and Nandarou, aired as one 15-second and four
        5-second spots, centered on an undefinable creature which ultimately
        became NTV's mascot. Miyazaki designed the storyboards and wrote the
        screenplay for Whisper of the Heart (1995), directed by Yoshifumi Kondō.

      Personal Life
    </h3>
    <div class="biography">
      Miyazaki married fellow animator Akemi Ota in October 1965. The couple
      have two sons: Gorō, born in January 1967, and Keisuke, born in April
      1969. Miyazaki's dedication to his work harmed his relationship with Gorō,
      as he was often absent. Gorō watched his father's works in an attempt to
      "understand" him, since the two rarely talked. During the production of
      Tales from Earthsea in 2006, Gorō said that his father "gets zero marks as
      a father but full marks as a director of animated films". Miyazaki's
      niece, Mei Okuyama, who was the inspiration behind the character Mei in My
      Neighbor Totoro, is married to animation artist Daisuke Tsutsumi.

      Renewal
    </h3>
    <div class="biography">
      On January 14, 1998, Miyazaki had announced that he would be leaving
      Studio Ghibli. His eyesight was failing, and he believed that he could not
      guarantee as high a quality of art in his motion pictures as he wished. He
      intended to make small films for the Studio Ghibli Museum—insisting that
      the museum should be full of children being noisy—and to train young
      animators. Yet on January 16, 1999, he returned as the shocho , or leader,
      of Studio Ghibli, taking a strong role in asserting organizational
      discipline and focusing employees on their tasks. Using computer animation
      to help maintain artistic control of his creations, he directed the fine
      The Cat Returns (2002), which featured the Baron from Whispers of the
      Heart , and Lord Howl's Castle (2004), based on the novel by Diana Wynne
      Jones.
